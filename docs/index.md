Our animal prefabs walk across the screen and get destroyed out of bounds, but they donâ€™t actually appear in the game unless we drag them in! In this lesson we will allow the animals to spawn on their own, in a random location at the top of the screen. In order to do so, we will create a new object and a new script to manage the entire spawning process.
